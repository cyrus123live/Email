#Email

This is a proof-of-concept of emailing, entering in your own email and access code to line 12 allows betterEmail.py to send message.txt as an email to your choice of recipient as an email.
This code could easily be modified to do all sorts of things such as sending emails with modified contents and sending many emails at once.
